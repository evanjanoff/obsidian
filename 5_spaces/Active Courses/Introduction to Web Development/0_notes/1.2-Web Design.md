## UI/UX Design Concepts
#### User Interface (UI)
- UI design is concerned with how the interface is structured, how information is presented, and how users interact with the visual elements and controls.
- Considerations for UI:
	- Visual Design: typography, colors, icons, and images.
	- Layout and Composition: spacing of elements, use of layout grids, and visual hierarchy.
	- Responsive Design: ensure the content looks good and functions correctly on various screen sizes.
	- Consistency: promote consistency in visual design and interactivity.
	- Navigation: ensure the navigation is meaningful and easy to understand and indicates the current location.
	- Accessibility: design and coding aspects that allow users with disabilities to access the site.
	- Feedback and Responsiveness: indications that the system is responding to the user.
#### User Experience (UX)
- UX focuses on the user’s perception and satisfaction during or after their interaction with the product, service, or site itself.
- Considerations for UX:
	- User’s Needs: ensure the design and functions are focused on meeting the user’s needs.
	- User Flow: ensure the user interactions are well planned out.
	- Usability: ensure the menus and controls are easy to use.
	- Performance: loading times and responsiveness to user interactions.
	- Emotional Design: ensure the emotional impact of the interface is positive.
	- Context: ensure the proper context and surrounding environment match the product or service.
	- User Feedback: ensure users have an opportunity to provide UI/UX feedback and that it is used to improve the design.
