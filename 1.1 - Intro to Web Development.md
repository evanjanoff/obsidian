			- **Web 2.0**: A shift toward social media and surveillance capitalism.
			- **Web 3.0**: The web as it exists today, natural language search, AI slop, enshittification.
	- ### How does the internet work?
		- Networks, and the individual hosts on the networks are able to communicate through a series of **protocols**, sets of standards and rules about how data is exchanged.
		- To access the information on the web a computer (client), makes a request to another computer (server). The server receives the request then responds to the client and attempts to fulfill the request. Server responses come with a code that explain why the response was processed the way it was.
